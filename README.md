Scope

The test is divided into two challenges. In the first implemetation, you will build a simple blog API, 
and in the second, implement an interface that consumes the data from your API.

You should see this challenge as an opportunity to create an app following modern development best practices,
but also feel free to use your own app architecture preferences (coding standards, code organization, third-party libraries, etc). 
The backend development should be coded in Python or C#

1. API
Build an API for a blog page that provides the following:
A news feed that shows the articles.
A way to store and get blog contacts (contact form).
Use Python or .NET framework to build this.

2. Frontend Interface
Create a Web interface for the API you created above. Must have the following features:
Create the interface using any technology of your preference. (TIP: component-oriented frameworks/libs help accelerate the development process)
Make it responsive using your best judgement.
Create a page to show the published articles.
Implements a way to view a single article in the blog.
Create a page with a contact form, where the user can send their name, email, phone, and message.

Deliverables
The project source code and dependencies should be made available in GitHub. Here are the steps you should follow:
• Create a public repository on GitHub (create an account if you don't have one).
• Create a "development" branch and commit the code to it. Do not push the code to the master branch.
• Create a "screenshots" sub-folder and include at least two screenshots of the app.
• Include a README file that describes:
• Special build instructions if any
• List of third-party libraries used and short description of why/how they were used
• Once the work is complete, create a pull request from "development" into "master" and send us the link.
• Avoid using huge commits hiding your progress. Feel free to work on a branch and use rebase to adjust your commits before submitting the final version.

Coding Standards
When working on the project be as clean and consistent as possible.
